#X text 43 395 Audio computation can be turned on and off by sending
messages to the global "pd" object as follows:;
#X msg 109 439 \; pd dsp 1;
#X msg 213 439 \; pd dsp 0;
#X text 124 476 ON;
#X text 233 476 OFF;
#X text 40 497 You should see the Pd window change to reflect whether
audio is on or off. You can also turn audio on and off using the "audio"
menu \, but the buttons are provided as a shortcut.;
#X text 41 568 When DSP is on \, you should hear a tone whose pitch
is A 440 and whose amplitude is 0.05. If instead you are greeted with
silence \, you might want to read the HTML documentation on setting
up audio.;
#X text 39 634 In general when you start a work session with Pd \,
you will want to choose "test audio and MIDI" from the help window
\, which opens a more comprehensive test patch than this one.;
#X text 307 447 <-- click these;
#X text 187 139 <-- reduce amplitude to 0.05;
#X text 283 218 <----- send to the audio output device;
#X text 32 23 Audio computation in Pd is done using "tilde objects"
such as the three below. They use continuous audio streams to intercommunicate
\, as well as communicating with other ("control") Pd objects using
messages.;
